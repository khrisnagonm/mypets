üöÄ Technologies Used
This project leverages a modern tech stack to provide a robust and user-friendly experience:

Frontend:

React: A powerful JavaScript library for building dynamic and responsive user interfaces.

React Router: For declarative routing within the single-page application.

Backend & Database:

Firebase (specifically Firestore Database): A flexible, scalable NoSQL cloud database for developing rich applications, integrated directly with your frontend.

Firebase Authentication (Optional, but common with Firestore): For user management and authentication.

Tools:

npm (Node Package Manager) or Yarn: For managing project dependencies.

‚öôÔ∏è Installation and Usage
Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

Node.js (LTS version recommended)

npm (comes with Node.js) or Yarn

Steps

Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/khrisnagonm/mypets.git


Navigate to the project directory:
cd mypets

Install frontend dependencies:
cd client # Assuming your React app is in a 'client' or 'frontend' folder
npm install

Install backend dependencies:
cd ../server # Assuming your Node.js/Express app is in a 'server' or 'backend' folder
npm install

Configure environment variables:

Create a .env file in your server (or backend) directory.

Add your database connection URI and any other necessary API keys or configurations. For example:

MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
PORT=5000

Run the backend server:
npm start

Run the frontend application:

Open a new terminal window.

Navigate back to your client (or frontend) directory:
cd client

Start the React development server:
npm start

The frontend application should now be running at http://localhost:3000 (or whatever port React starts on), and it will connect to your backend server running on the specified port (e.g., http://localhost:5000).
